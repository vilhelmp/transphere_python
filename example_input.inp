# 'rstar' gives the radius of the star. It relates to the luminosity as:
# sqrt(35.7), RSUN [ L/Lsun = (R/Rsun)**2 * (T/Tsun)**4 ]
# so putting Tstar as Tsun we control the luminosity only by the 
# Radius, taking Rstar = sqrt(L/Lsun) we get the R/Rsun value
# applicable for our model.

# Next up is the radial sampling
# 'nin' - number of points in the refinement
# 'nout' - number of points outside the refinement 
# 'rref' - outer radius of the refinement
# 'rin' - inner radius of the grid
# 'rout' - outer radius of the grid
# naturally, rin < rref < rout must hold

# 'wl_interval' - gives the [start, stopstart, stopstart, stop]
# points for the grid
# 'wl_points' - gives the number of points in each interval
# so e.g. wl_interval = [0.01,7.0,50.0,5e4], and wl_points = [50,40,40]
# would give a grids between, 0.01-7.0, 7.0-50.0 and 50.0-5E4 microns
